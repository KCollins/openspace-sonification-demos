## Why it's interesting

## Position Data

SPICE orbital data, with additional assets to show the distance between the spacecraft and the sun, and also showing trails for several orbits.

## Science Data

Audification by Robert Alexander: "Encounter 18, beginning at 2023-12-26 00:56 and running through 2024-01-01 00:56. It's centered around the perihelion crossing, including 3 days before and 3 days after. I've compressed the 6 days worth of data down into one minute of audio and provided some processing to help lessen some of the harsh edge on the sound and make it a bit more pleasant to the ears. Here we're listening to data gathered by the FIELDS fluxgate magnetometer, with Bt panned hard left and Bn panned hard right to provide some spatialization to the sound." 

The audification is synced with OpenSpace to start at 2023-12-26 00:56 and plays with a normal rate when the time speed is 2 hours per second, which results in the audification ending at 2024-01-01 00:56.
